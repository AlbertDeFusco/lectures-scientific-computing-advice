lectures-scientific-computing-advice
====================================

There are a plethora of techniques, tools, languages, and platforms available to help you scientifically compute. It is likely that you will only be able to afford a limited amount of time learning a subset of them. The purpose of this lecture is to help orient you on the path to writing software as part of your research by: 

* introducing the important tools and paradigms of software construction
* relating them to your role as a scientist, and
* making specific recommendations for 
    + selecting tools that you should be using 
    + and practices that you should be following

* three themes I focus on are:
    + **reducing complexity**
    + **automating your workflow**
    + **encouraging experimentation**
