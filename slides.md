## Introduction

There are a plethora of techniques, tools, languages, and platforms available to help you scientifically compute. It is likely that you will only be able to afford a limited amount of time learning a subset of them. The purpose of this lecture is to help orient you on the path to writing software as part of your research by: 

>
* introducing the important tools and paradigms of software construction
* relating them to your role as a scientist, and
* making specific recommendations for 
    + selecting tools that you should be using 
    + and practices that you should be following

>
* three themes I will focus on are:
    + **reducing complexity**
    + **automating your workflow**
    + **encouraging experimentation**

Keywords in **bold** are important concepts, notes in *italics* are my own personal advocacy.

# Understand the Languages of Computing 

## Be fluent in multiple languages
You speak multiple languages when interacting with a computer.  Choosing to use a new tool, library, or language can be similar to learning a new language:

>
+ There is a high initial startup cost as you learn vocabulary, grammar, and idioms  
<font color=blue>`sum(x*y for x,y in itertools.izip(x_vector, y_vector))`</font color>
+ You will learn faster by observing and working with others who are more skilled than you
+ But once you have gained some fluency, you will find yourself capable of new things!

## Use domain specific languages and libraries to increase your expressivity 

* Aim for languages and tools that allow you to express your models simply, whether that is symbolically, numerically, or like [`chebfun`](http://www2.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun/), a strange union of the two. 

## Motivating Example: Chebfun

Chebfun teaser from the [website](http://www2.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun/)

```{.matlab}
% What's the integral of sin(sin(x)) from 0 to 10?
>> x = chebfun('x',[0 10]); sum(sin(sin(x)))

% What's the maximum of sin(x)+sin(x2) over the same interval?
>> x = chebfun('x',[0 10]); sum(sin(sin(x)))

% What's the solution to u"-xu=1 with zero boundary conditions on [-20,20]? 
>> L = chebop(@(x,u)diff(u,2)-x.*u,[-20,20],'dirichlet'); plot(L\1)
```

## Motivating Example: FEniCS solving Poisson

[Dolfin Example 7](http://fenicsproject.org/documentation/dolfin/1.0.0/python/demo/pde/poisson/python/documentation.html), part of the [FEniCS project](http://fenicsproject.org/)

```{.python}
from dolphin import *
# Create mesh and define function space
mesh = UnitSquare(32, 32)
V = FunctionSpace(mesh, "Lagrange", 1)

# Define Dirichlet boundary (x = 0 or x = 1)
def boundary(x):
    return x[0] < DOLFIN_EPS or x[0] > 1.0 - DOLFIN_EPS

# Define boundary condition
u0 = Constant(0.0)
bc = DirichletBC(V, u0, boundary)

# Define variational problem
u = TrialFunction(V)
v = TestFunction(V)
f = Expression("10*exp(-(pow(x[0] - 0.5, 2) + 
    pow(x[1] - 0.5, 2)) / 0.02)")
g = Expression("sin(5*x[0])")
a = inner(grad(u), grad(v))*dx
L = f*v*dx + g*v*ds

# Compute solution
u = Function(V)
solve(a == L, u, bc)
```

## Self-Promoting Example: PyClaw solving Acoustics 

[PyClaw example](http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa/pyclaw/tutorial.html) from [the paper submitted to the SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing](http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa/papers/pyclaw-sisc/pyclaw-sisc.html).

```{.python}

from clawpack import pyclaw
from clawpack import riemann

# Define the equations and the solution algorithm
solver = pyclaw.ClawSolver2D(riemann.rp2_euler_4wave)

# Define the problem domain
domain = pyclaw.Domain([0.,0.],[1.,1.],[100,100])
solver.all_bcs = pyclaw.BC.extrap
solution = pyclaw.Solution(solver.num_eqn,domain)

# Set physical parameters
gamma = 1.4
solution.problem_data['gamma']  = gamma

# Set initial data
xx,yy = domain.grid.p_centers
l = xx<0.5; r = xx>=0.5; b = yy<0.5; t = yy>=0.5
solution.q[0,...] = 2.*l*t + 1.*l*b + 1.*r*t + 3.*r*b
solution.q[1,...] = 0.75*t - 0.75*b
solution.q[2,...] = 0.5*l  - 0.5*r
solution.q[3,...] = 0.5*solution.q[0,...]* \
                    (solution.q[1,...]**2+solution.q[2,...]**2) \
                    + 1./(gamma-1.)

# Solve
solver.evolve_to_time(solution,tend=0.3)            

# Plot
pyclaw.plot.interactive_plot()
```

## Use REPL Environments for Development

**REPL (read-eval-print-loop)** environments tighten the coupling between the code you write and the results you see, increasing productivity.

REPL                                        non-REPL
-------------------          -----------------------
Visual Basic                 Supercomputers     
Command Line                 C
IPython and Python           C++
MATLAB                       Java
Mathematica                  Fortran
LISP

## Understand the limitations of floating-point numbers, learn symbolic tools as well
* As a computational scientist, you will likely be working with numerical systems solved using floating point numbers
    + *pay attention when Prof. Macdonald covers them later this term!*
    + The excellent article *What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic* is a great way to do some advance reading

* Don't limit yourself to numerical computations, use symbolic tools such as SAGE, SymPy and Mathematica as well when they make sense

# Don't Repeat Yourself (or Others)

## Automate common actions by saving simple blocks of code into **scripts**

>
* A script is a set of commands organized into a single file
* Sometimes it takes a few arguments, but more often there are just some parameters at the top of the file to modify
* The script is the basest unit of scientific programming, you should be comfortable writing these whenever you want to save or otherwise document or repeat your actions
* Use scripts to explore new ideas, they are easy to write and throw away
* **Don't repeat commands into your REPL, save them to a script**

## Refactor commonly used blocks of code into **functions**
>
* Eventually, you will find that your scripts have a lot of repeated code, or that you are spending a lot of time adjusting parameters at the top of the file
* Refactor out repeated code into **function calls** in your scripts and implement the **function** either in the same file or a separate one
* Be comfortable with the calling and return syntax of your programming language environment, whether it is BASH or Python
* **Don't repeat code in scripts, refactor them to functions**

## Group commonly used functions into **libraries**
>
* If you are unlucky enough to have to write a lot of software functions for your work, you might want to consider designing and releasing a library so that others do not have to share your misfortune
* You might want to first check that nobody else has implemented the functionality you need
* If something close exists, it may be worth adapting to your needs if the project is of high quality and suitably licensed
* *Openly licensed non-commercial libraries tend to have a much longer effective lifespan than unreleased codes*
* **Share your code with others, and use their code**

## Design languages around commonly used paradigms

>
* I am not Guido van Rossum or Cleve Moler, but you could be!

# Reduce Complexity

## Basic strategies

>
* Endeavor to use languages and libraries that reduce the complexity of your work
* It is worth installing a complicated or expensive software tool if your computations are naturally expressed with it
* Always look for opportunities to write **less** code
    + you will have to do less initial work (sometimes)
    + you will introduce less bugs
    + your code will be easier to understand and maintain
* When writing software, try to keep individual functions short, single-purpose, and avoid excessive nesting

# Organize, Checkpoint, and Collaborate

## Back up your data!

## Organize with wikis

* organize your personal notes into a personal wiki (gollum, gitit, instiki)
* organize your shared notes into a group wiki (gollum, gitit, instiki)
* *improve the layperson's understanding of your field by editing Wikipedia*

## Use version Control for checkpointing and collaboration

* use local version control software to checkpoint personal code development
  + checkpointing your work encourages wild ideas and late-night coding sessions
  + you can easily restore back in the morning if it was a bad idea
* use **distributed version control** to collaborate with others
* I advocate *git*, but you may be stuck with whatever your group uses
  + though check out git-svn for using git to collaborate with an svn repository, it's awesome!

# Verify and Validate your Code

## Principles of verification and validation
* **verification** - is your code correctly written?
* **validation** - do your computations accurately model the physical phenomena in question?
* test frameworks help you verify your code, but validation is usually a manual process
 + although it is desirable to write regression tests that verify previously validated results hold true when the code has been modified!
* use the **method of manufactured solutions** to verify correctness of code
* use **comparisons to experiment** to validate code
* use **comparisons to similar software** as an additional check

# Document your Computational Work

## Principles of documentation
* Save every bit of code you use for generating publishable results
* Document and comment your code for yourself as if you will need to understand it in 6 months
  + use README files liberally
  + as well as file-level, function-level, and inline documentation
* If any piece of code is too complex to easily describe, consider refactoring it

# Closing Thoughts 

## Aim for reproducibility
* The goals of non-review scientific publications are to:
    + Describe a new result or approach
    + Convince others of its usefulness
* The **reproducibility** of your publication will greatly benefit both of these goals
* An important new tool in this domain is <http://RunMyCode.org>, which allows other scientists to reproduce your computational results on the cloud
* See also <http://figshare.com> for an easy way to store and share your data in an easily-cited way

## Questions for the lecturer
* Why do senior computational scientists recommend against using libraries?
* How do I evaluate the usefulness of other people's code?
